<p><strong>The Department of the Interior Has Significant Hiring Demands… and Hiring Managers Have a Critical Role in the Process.</strong></p>

<p>The Department of the Interior has a workforce of 80,156 employees and hired 14,890 employees in the third quarter of FY 2011 alone. </p>

<p>OPM recently mandated that new Federal Government hires take no more than 80 days. The DOI is streamlining and improving its hiring process in response. 
As a Hiring Manager, it is critical that you understand your role and responsibilities associated with OPM’s 80-day hiring.</p>
